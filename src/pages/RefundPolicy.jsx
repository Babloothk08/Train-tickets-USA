                            Our Refund Policy lays out the rules you will need to follow regarding cancellations and refund requests when you use Train Tickets USA's Booking Assistance Services. Train Tickets USA will work with your train operator to provide you with accurate adjudication timelines, processes, and service fees so that you can make the best decision possible before you make an appointment. Refund eligibility is established by the fare rules and company policies of third-party rail operators; thus, it is important for you to thoroughly review your reservation detail to check for possible ways to be ineligible to receive a refund. By creating this policy, we are able to provide users of Train Tickets USA's Booking Assistance Services clarity and reduce any potential confusion while providing a fair, consistent, and user-friendly way to make exemption requests and to ensure every user has a positive booking experience.
